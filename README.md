# Personal Website

This is the repo for my personal website. Until now it mainly serves as a front for my email adress and link to a few of my social pages/ways to contact me.

The website is based on my standart template for boostrap webpages and reuses code for color mode and cookie banner from other repos.

It supports a native dark mode with preferences saved in cookies and changing logos depending on the color. The design is synced across my linkedin, cv, etc.
